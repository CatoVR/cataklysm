This is a custom plugin I'm developing for my personal Minecraft server.
Before starting this project, I hadn't worked with plugins in over five years â€” so it's been both a challenging and rewarding experience.

Throughout the development process, I've been learning a lot of new techniques and refreshing my skills. 
The project is still a work in progress, and there's plenty of code I plan to revisit for optimization and improved readability.
